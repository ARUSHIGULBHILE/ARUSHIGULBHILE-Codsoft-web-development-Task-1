         <h3>HTML</h3>
         <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It consists of a series of elements (tags) that define the structure of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and forms. HTML provides the basic building blocks for web content, allowing browsers to interpret and display text, multimedia, and hyperlinks.</p>

         <h3>CSS</h3>
         <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of web pages. It defines how HTML elements are displayed on the screen, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. CSS allows developers to separate content (HTML) from design, making it easier to maintain and scale websites. It also supports responsive design, enabling web pages to look good on various devices like mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.

     <h3>BOOTSTRAP</h3>
     <p>Bootstrap is a popular open-source framework used for building responsive, mobile-first websites. It provides a collection of pre-designed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components like navigation bars, forms, buttons, modals, and more, which help developers quickly create visually appealing and functional web pages without having to write a lot of custom code. Key features include a grid system for layout design, reusable UI components, and compatibility across various browsers and devices. Bootstrap simplifies front-end development by making it easier to maintain consistency across different screen sizes.
